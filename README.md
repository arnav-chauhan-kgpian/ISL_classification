# Intelligent ISL Gesture Recognition<br>
Project performed by- Arnav Chauhan, UG Student [IIT-Kharagpur'27] <br>
The aim was to create an advanced deep-learning model designed to recognize and interpret Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures with precision. <br>Using state-of-the-art neural networks, this project aims to bridge the communication gap by converting hand gestures into meaningful text.<br>

The project involves gentle but meticulous data augmentation, usage of custom convolutionary networks and Residual Blocks inspired from ResNet architecture. The dataset involved was very rudimentarily collected with lot of noise and much experimentation had to be done with augmentation part.This model has been built and trained from scratch. I have incorporated Depth Wise Residual Blocks, Squeeze and Excitation Blocks and Depthwise Convolutional Layers into a abridged modified version of the Resnet-34 architecture to achieve outstanding accuracy. <br>

Bearing fruit to these efforts, I have achieved a ~99% accuracy on validation dataset. <br>

For this project, I have used the Indian Sign Language (ISLRTC referred) dataset available on Kaggle. The user will have to generate his/her own kaggle api token to load the dataset.<br>

Thank you!
